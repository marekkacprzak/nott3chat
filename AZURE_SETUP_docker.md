🎯 Summary of Docker + ACR Deployment
I've created a comprehensive Docker deployment solution for your NotT3Chat backend with Azure Container Registry. Here's what was created:

📁 Files Created:

Dockerfile - Multi-stage Docker build with security best practices
.dockerignore - Optimized build context
docker-compose.yml - Local development environment
deploy-acr.ps1 - Complete ACR deployment automation
build-docker.ps1 - Local build script
deploy-acr.yml - CI/CD pipeline
DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md - Comprehensive deployment guide

🚀 Quick Start Examples:
Local Development:

# Build locally
.\build-docker.ps1

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up

Deploy to Azure:

.\deploy-acr.ps1 `
  -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" `
  -ResourceGroupName "nott3chat-containers-rg" `
  -AcrName "nott3chatacr" `
  -WebAppName "nott3chat-container-app" `
  -AzureOpenAIEndpoint "https://your-openai.openai.azure.com/"
